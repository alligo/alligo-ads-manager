# Alligo Simple Advertising Manager
FREE Simple Advertising Manager, for self-hosted banners rotation that can be 
included on 3rd sites.

## For who is this tool?

This is a simple, yet fully functional, way to configure one site to show banners
in another sites via `iframe` HTML tag. If configured, you can track banners 
exhibitions and banners clicks with Google Analytics.


## For who is not recommended this tool
If you really need something more complex, like limit max exhibitions, or want
to manange really large amounts of banners and edit a php configuration file
is too hard, you shold try another solutions for this.

If your case is more simple, and you just want one simple banner with image,
maybe the sites that you want to share you banner already have a way to just
use your image instead of force you to have your own simple ads server.

# Requeriments
Requires only **PHP 5.4+**. No databases.
